# HistoryOfAviationCrashes

In 2018, commercial airlines transported a total of 4.3 billion passengers across the globe according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (2018). That's 37 million flight departures (Air transport, 2019), with only 11 fatal crashes, a total of 0.00002%. More passengers than ever are travelling by air and yet, this number civilian of fatal crashes matches the number of crashes in 1926. It should come as no surprise then that the Washington Post (2015) reported flying as the safest method of travel per unit distance travelled. There has been a clear downward trend in the raw number of fatal crashes over the years, in spite of the exponential growth in popularity of air travel over the past few decades.

It is still important that we remember the path that we have taken to get to where we are today. Be it mechanical malfunctions, weather, war or human error, the plane crashes of history helped to shape aviation safety as we know it. As the saying goes in aviation, regulations are written in blood.
